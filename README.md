# DoubleHelix
 A design system which illustrates how simple rules make up complex structures and systems.
 
 This system is modeled from how DNA works, DNA has a structure of a double helix hence the name DoubleHelix.

 DNA is a blue print which contains rules which control how every structure in an organism looks, how every process which work, in a nut shell the rules in DNA controls everything about an organism.

 Complex organisms and systems look extremely complex from the outside, but if you dive deeper and go at the most fundamental level of their architecture you realize that they are composed of simple rules, these rules combine using a permutation to produce a variety of complex structures.

 This design system is a means to create an entity called a "service". A service is the thing which satisfies user needs.

 What is a service?
 -- The concept of a service is stolen from how real world entities such as banks work. 
 -- A service is something that fulfills a need or solves a problem for someone else.
 -- A valuable action or task that one party can offer to another

DoubleHelix -> Service -> Help user achieve task.

## The Concept of a gene
 A gene is a fundamental unit of heredity that carries instructions for the development, functioning, and maintenance of living organisms. Genes are composed of DNA, and each gene contains a specific sequence of nucleotides that encode information for building and maintaining proteins or influencing other cellular functions. The combination of genes determines an organism's traits, characteristics, and overall biological makeup.

 Let me tell you one important thing about people:
 - "They haven't come to see how beautiful your product is."
So if people haven't come to behold the splendor of your product, then what have they come to do?
The answer to that is obvious, people come to use your product to achieve a goal which *you* promised they will be able to achieve by using your product.
